                In the realm of software engineering, the pursuit of growth and mastery is a journey marked by challenges and discoveries. My journey with Andela's Technical Leadership Training Program (ATLP) has been nothing short of extraordinaryâ€”a testament to the power of dedication, learning, and seizing golden opportunities.

Like other software engineers, I wanted a place where I can be able to improve my technical skills in software development while also using it to solve our daily real-life problems. As I started in this field, I began to search for a place that met all the criteria I needed to become an excellent female software engineer. One day I attended a tech event, and during the networking period, I talked to a person who is currently working for the Bank of Kigali while he was talking, he mentioned that he does not have any university degree, but after attending the ATLP, that's when he secured a job at Bk, to be honest after hearing his story I got burning desire to join this training too because I believed that it will offer me all things I needed to be a competent software engineer at today's job market.

            I applied, and fortunately, I got accepted into the program in cohort 30. So far, I've learned many things, but two are self-discipline and being a good communicator. Before I joined the ATLP, I didn't know the value of effective communication, like giving feedback to people or even informing before that I may be late for a specific meeting or any other activity like class and others. Self-discipline is also another core skill that I have learned at Andela so far because, for example, when we are given something to do in coding, I have to program myself and learn it on my own, keeping in mind that no one owns my life and even my learning expects me, hence also creating a growth mindset that if others can so I can do it too and this is contributing for me being a world-class software engineer who will be able to be a good problem solver and also a good leader with communication skills while using software engineering knowledge I acquired to bring good impacts and changes to my community.

            My plan after completing the ATLP is to start using the knowledge I acquired during this training and start working on my mission which is to improve the agriculture system in Rwanda while using technology because I believe that if technology can be used more in agriculture, our country can be developed. Also, we can be able to increase food security in our country.

            My message and advice to any young people who are applying for this program in the future are to do and never let this golden opportunity pass by because once they get admitted to the program, they will be able to learn more skills that even more cultural universities can not provide. Another thing I can tell them is to never give up on their dreams because even though the ATLP requires more effort in the end, it gives a reward.
